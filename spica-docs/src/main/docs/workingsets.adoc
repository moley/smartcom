= Handle a set of source at once with workingsets
:nofooter:

= What is a workingset?

A *workingset* represents all things you need to work on a special task.
For example it contains a set of source part infos, each represents a part of source which is
checked out from a code repository. A workingset is always associated with a concrete folder,
were all source parts are locally checked out.

= Create a workingset

A workingset can be created by a commandline call ``s w create [NAME]``.
Afterwards you have an empty workingset.

= Show workingsets

On the commandline call ``s w list`` to show a list of all available workingsets.

To see details of a workingset call ``s w show [NAME|ID]``.
This shows a workingset and all its source parts. It shows also if the sourcepart is
enabled or disabled

= Remove an existing workingset

On the commandline call ``s w remove [NAME|ID]`` to remove a certain project.

= Import sourceparts to workingset

Importing sourceparts fills the workingset with live.

====
If you import sourceparts to workingset be aware that the current working dir is used as
associated folder where the workingset is stored on local filesystem.
====


== ...from bitbucket project

On the commandline call ``s w import [URL TO BITBUCKET PROJECT] [BRANCH]``
to add all branches named [BRANCH] from this bitbucket project.

Afterwards spica shows which source parts are imported and
which sourceparts already exist in the workingset.

====
*Example1:* If you want to import all branches *master* from all repos in the project PROJECT type
``s w import [BITBUCKET_URL] PROJECT master``
====

If a part of your branch name represents your project or module you can use variables to be
replaced:

* \#project# -> the projectname
* \#module# -> the modulename in the project
* \#projectLower# -> the projectname lowercase
* \#moduleLower# -> the modulename in the project lowercase

====
*Example2:* If you have a project PROJECT and two modules module1 and module2 and you want to add branches

* project_module1_0 from module1
* project_module2_0 from module2

you use variable replacement the following way:

``s w import [BITBUCKET_URL] PROJECT '#project#_#repo#_0'``
====

== ...from local filesystem

If you already have a collection of modules checked out in a specific folder you can also
import these modules from filesystem. Step to the folder, which contain the source modules
and call ``s w import [FOLDER]``. Afterwards spica shows which source parts are imported and
which sourceparts already exist in the workingset.


= Enable, disable or remove a sourcepart

A disabled sourcepart is ignored when calling actions on the workingset.
If you want to disable a sourcepart you call
``s w modules [WORKINGSET] -disable [MODULEID]

If you want to reenable a disabled sourcepart you call
``s w modules [WORKINGSET] -enable [MODULEID]

If you want to completely remove a sourcepart you call
``s w modules [WORKINGSET] -remove [MODULEID]

= Clone all sourceparts of a workingset

Now as you have added sourceparts to the workingset you can check out all sourceparts on your commandline.
Step to a folder were you want to host all your local sourceparts of the workingset and call
``s w clone [NAME |Â URL]``.
Afterwards all source parts should be cloned in the current directory.

= Reset workingset

Resets all local changes on all sourceparts of the workingset.
Call ``s w reset [WORKINGSET]``
