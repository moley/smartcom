= Import logfiles into spica
You can call ``s i logs``to zip logs together and insert them into the clipboard of the spica
fx client.

* ``s i logs --all`` copies all logfiles

* ``s i logs --stack`` copies only logfiles which contain stacktraces

If you have imported it into fxclient you can e.g. create a task or send it to another user
