= Import logfiles into spica

If you want to easily create a task and want to add logfiles to it or you want to communicate with
a collegue about an error this is just two steps away.

Call ``s i logs``to zip logs together and insert them into the clipboard of the spica
fx client.

* ``s i logs --all`` copies all logfiles

* ``s i logs --stack`` copies only logfiles which contain stacktraces

Afterwards the clipboard in spica has notified that you have added a document and should show a small _1_.
With this done you can e.g. create a task. Afterwards the clipboard is empty again and the task you have
created contains an attachment with the zipfile.
