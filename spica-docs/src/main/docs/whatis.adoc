Spica is a suite of tools to improve and ease every days live for people working together on projects.
It provides todo handling, communication and automation features. Both commandline client and fx client
improve processes

== Components
Spica is composed of multiple independent components, which interact directly with each other.

=== Commandline interface
The commandline interface can be used to work directly in the commandline. It uses consoleui to
interact with the user.

=== FX client
The fx client can be used to get a quick overview and visualize things on laptops. Native
installers are generated to have an easy installation process.

=== Spica server
The spica server enables working together of different user and synchronizing the model between
the different clients. It is a spring boot server application distributed in a docker container
and needs a SQL database (h2 by default) to save the model.
