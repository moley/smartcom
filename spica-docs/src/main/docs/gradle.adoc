= Init gradle project

If you want to init a gradle project, step into your projectfolder and call ``s g init [VERSION|URL] [-all|-bin]``.
Afterwards all files, which are necessary to have a gradle project, are created if they do not exist.

If you only call ``s g init`` you are asked for the version to be used and bin distribution is used as default.
