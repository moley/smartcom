= Write an 'HELLO WORLD' automation script

Spica can be extended with groovy scripts.
For example write the following script:

.Hello world script
----
println "Hello world from spica..."
----

and save it.

= Call an automation script

If you have an automation script written you can call it with ``s a execute [PATH]``.

= Using the API

In your groovy script you have access to the complete model via a variable *spica*.
This variable is mapped to the interface link:../javadoc/spica-javaclient/org/spica/javaclient/actions/ActionContext.html[org.spica.javaclient.actions.ActionContext]

.Groovy Script which has access to the complete spica model
----
import org.spica.javaclient.actions.ActionContext
import org.spica.javaclient.services.Services

ActionContext actionContext = spica  // <1>

//If page changes, we send a mail with the new version to be up to date.
Services services = actionContext.services  //<2>
boolean siteChanged = services.downloadService.siteChanged("https://gradle.org/releases/");<3>
println "Site changed: " + siteChanged
if (siteChanged) {
  services.mailService.sendMail("Spica detected a new gradle version", "Bla",
                                Arrays.asList("user1@spica.org"))
}
----
<1> Get the implementation class of the api
<2> Get services
<3> Use a special service
